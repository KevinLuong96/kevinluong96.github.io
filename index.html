    <p>Hey! Thanks for visiting my website. </p>
    <img class="about-picture picture" src="img/about.png">
    <p>
      I am a Systems Design Engineering student at the 
      University of Waterloo that's set to graduate in 2020. I love creating 
      things, whether it be with my own two hands, with a couple strokes on the
      keyboard, or even with scissors and some glue. The first time I 3D printed 
      a housing for my first year design project that I created on SolidWorks, 
      I remember holding it in my hands and thinking "Wow! I made it and its not 
      horrible!" Since then, I've learned more about the world of software and 
      it feels like the only thing I've learned is how much more there is to 
      learn! On this website you'll find a collection of past, present and future 
      projects, I'll update it regularly as I make more things so stay tuned!
